In the first part of the project I simply built a bar chart for visualizing active energy burned in the last couple of years from the apple health data.

In this part, I have added couple interactions to make it more human readable.

First Interaction: With mouse-over the current bar will be highlighted in orange and will display its energy burned value. Upon mouse-out, the color of the bar will be reset to steelblue.

Second Interaction: A click button is added in the page. Name of the button is "Update". This works as an event listener. Upon button-click, a line chart of the data shows up in the screen. The line chart has the axis and scales for effective human reading.

ActivitySummary.csv file holds date-wise active energy burned since November 2018. 
index2.html is the main html file for this project, in which javascript and css style sheet files are coded.
